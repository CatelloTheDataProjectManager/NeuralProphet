In the "Time Serie Model with NeuralProphet" notebook, I use the NeuralProphet framework to build and train a neural network model for forecasting future values of a time series. The model is applied to a dataset of historical sales data, and autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis are used to determine the appropriate lag order.

The NeuralProphet model is evaluated based on its root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), which are common metrics for assessing the accuracy of time series forecasting models. The results show that the model has a low RMSE and MAE, indicating good forecast accuracy.

Additionally, the forecasted values are visualized and compared to the actual values to evaluate the model's performance. The results show that the NeuralProphet model is able to accurately forecast future values of the time series.

Overall, the NeuralProphet model is an efficient and effective tool for time series forecasting, with low RMSE and MAE values and accurate forecasts. It can be a valuable asset for businesses and organizations looking to make data-driven decisions based on historical trends and patterns.

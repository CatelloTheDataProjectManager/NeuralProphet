# ðŸ“ˆTime-Series Analysis and Modeling with NeuralProphet
This project includes two Jupyter notebooks that showcase time series analysis and modeling using the NeuralProphet library.
###### (Modeling and Multivariate Regression are essential tools for understanding how these pre-trained models work and how they can be effectively used to solve complex natural language processing problems. [Introduction Ã  la ModÃ©lisation et Ã  la RÃ©gression MultivariÃ©e](https://github.com/CatelloTheDataProjectManager/Introduction-Modelisation-Regression-Multivarie/blob/main/README.md))

In the *"Zalando Stock Actions Analysis"* notebook, I analyze a time series dataset of historical stock prices for Zalando. The analysis includes measures of dispersion, trend, and frequency of extreme values, as well as testing for normality and stationarity. I also decompose the time series into its components and apply the Box-Cox transformation to stabilize the variance.

In the *"Time Serie Model with NeuralProphet"* notebook, I build and train a NeuralProphet model to forecast future values of a time series. The model is applied to a dataset of historical sales data, and I use autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis to determine the appropriate lag order. The forecasted values are then visualized and compared to the actual values.
